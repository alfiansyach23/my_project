   events in various product categories, and in order to maintain a high level of revenue from the furniture product category and in
   order to increase revenue in other product categories that have low revenue levels.

   evaluate sellers so that they can make deliveries faster in order to increase customer satisfaction levels.
3. Regarding order status, orders with delivery status are quite dominating and this is good news, but it would be better in the future,
   the company can urge sellers to increase delivery status in various product categories, especially product categories that still
   experience many problems such as shipped and unavailable.
4. Credit card payment type is the most widely used payment type, and the company can provide various special benefits for credit card
   types, with that, customers will be more interested in continuing to shop.
