## RESULT OF ANALYSIS

There are 25 cohorts based on invoice date (Dec 2019 - Dec 2011), which means the total customers grouped by invoice date. Even though the customer has transacted many times, but in this cohort analysis it is only calculated based on the customer when he first made a transaction

For Cohort Distance 0, which means the total number of customers based on the invoice date, which means that in December 2009 the total number of customers was 1045

In December 2009 there were 1045 customers who made transactions, however:
1.	In the next month, January 2010, there were only 392 (37.51%) customers who made transactions again.
2.	And two months later, in February 2010, there were only 358 (34.26%) customers who returned to make transactions.
3.	So, based on the analysis results, it can be seen that the trend of total customers from December 2009 to December 2011 is reduced by
   79.14%.
